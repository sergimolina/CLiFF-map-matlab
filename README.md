# CLiFF-map-matlab
The MATLAB implementation of CLiFF-map a dynamic mapping algorithm

## What is CLiFF-map?
CLiFF-map stands for Circular-Linear Flow Field map. It is a representation allowing to model a local flow. If you are interested in details please read my RA-L paper[1].

## What can I find in this repository?
In this repository you can find a simple example showing how to model a flow of air in observed locations. Just run the air_flow.m script. In order to show the capabilities of the method I have used a wind measurements obtained by Yuta Wada, Marco Trincavelli, Yuichiro Fukazawa and Hiroshi Ishida[2].

## When there will be more code published?
Soon! 
Currently I am organising my research code and preparing it for release. I will try to do it as fast as possible.

## I have so many questions!
Please feel free to send me an e-mail!
